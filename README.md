# Chuck Norris Quote Tracker

The main focus of this task was to use APIs and databases in Next.JS. This quote tracker fetches a list of quotes from https://api.chucknorris.io/jok
es/search?query=hand and allows the user read and increment a counter every time the quote has been uttered and store the value in a Firestore database. It also allows the user to read and write comments.
